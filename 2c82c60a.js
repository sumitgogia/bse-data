                  ), in connivance with her father, is refusing to vacate our
                  property. While this may seem like a typical "cash for keys"
                  situation, it is far from ordinary. Many advisors, including
                  lawyers, have suggested that we pay the demanded money to
                  avoid the stress of a lengthy legal battle. However, the
                  casual and blatant manner in which our tenant and her father
                  have approached this issue has shocked us. It seems to be
                  business as usual for them, and they seem to enjoy the
                  harrasment caused to us by delaying the inevitable. Giving in
                  to their demands will simply make them bolder, and make them
                  do this again to others.
